Bugs and feature requests in PSPP are handled by the bug database
at http://sv.gnu.org/bugs/?group=pspp

We use the following conventions for classiying / ranking bugs:

Release:
* Bugs which we think must be fixed before a release get their "Release" field set accordingly.
* Bugs which need not be fixed before any particular release, get their "Release" field set to "Future".
* Bugs where we have not get decided are left at "None".

Severity:
* Feature requests have their "Severity" field set to "Wishlist".
* Bugs which cause a crash or other unwanted effects when incorrect input is given are "Average".
* Bugs which cause a crash when correct input is given are "Major"
* Bugs which render the software unusable are "Blocker"

Obviously some cases are unclear and judgement has to be used.
